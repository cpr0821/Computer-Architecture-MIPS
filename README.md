# Computer-Architecture-MIPS

The files in this repository are programs that I wrote for my Computer Architecture class in the Spring of 2019. We wrote in MIPS using 
Mars. We learned basic MIPS operations, floating point operations, file input and output, macros, functions and loops, and how to use a heap and stack with MIPS.
